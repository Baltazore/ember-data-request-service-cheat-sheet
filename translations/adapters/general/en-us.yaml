title: Adapters in general
description: |
  In order to provide migration support for Adapter and Serializer, a '<code>'LegacyNetworkHandler'</code>' would be provided. This handler would take a request and convert it into the older form, calling the appropriate Adapter and Serializer methods. If no adapter exists for the type (including no application adapter), this handler would call '<code>'next'</code>'. In this manner an app can incrementally migrate request-handling to this new paradigm on a per-type basis as desired.
  <br />
  The package '<code>'ember-data'</code>' would automatically configure this handler. If not using '<code>'ember-data'</code>' this configuration would need to be done explicitly.
  <br />
  We intend to support this handler through at least the 5.x series, not deprecating it's usage before 6.0.
  <br />
  Similarly, the methods '<code>'adapterFor'</code>' and '<code>'serializerFor'</code>' will not be deprecated until at least 6.0; however, it should no longer be assumed that an application has an adapter or serializer at all.
