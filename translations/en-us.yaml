#   title: Actions

#   actions:
#     title: Use @action, on, and fn instead of action
#     description: "Use the @action decorator in your JavaScript to indicate functions that you want to be able to use in a template. Use those functions in the template with \"on,\" and if you need to pass an argument to the function, use \"fn\" too. (<a href=\"https://guides.emberjs.com/release/components/component-state-and-actions/#toc_html-modifiers-and-actions\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Visit the Ember Guides to learn more</a>.)"

#   template-arguments-default:
#     title: Specifying a default value for an argument
#     description: Because arguments are read only, their values cannot be changed so no default value can be set. To have a default-value-like experience, native getters may be used.

#   mixins:
#     title: Mixins
#     description: You cannot use mixins on anything that uses Native Class syntax (such as components that import from @glimmer/component). The replacement strategy depends on your use case. If your app depends on an addon that uses Mixins, it may be best to continue using classic components until an alternative is ready.
#     octaneDescription: "See <a href=\"https://www.pzuraq.com/do-you-need-ember-object/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Do you need Ember Object?</a> for Mixin alternatives, such as utility functions, services, delegates, and class decorators."

#   constructors:
#     title: Using constructor instead of init
#     description: "constructor is a feature of JavaScript Native Classes, not something Ember made up. Use it instead of init. No more this.set!

#   render-modifiers:
#     title: Element Modifiers
#     description:
#       "<p>There are three new element modifiers, \\{\\{did-insert\\}\\}, \\{\\{did-update\\}\\}, and \\{\\{will-destroy\\}\\}, that you may use to replace the classic component lifecycle hooks didInsertElement, willDestroy, and didUpdate.
#       </p>
#       <p>
#         In order for these modifiers to work, you need to install the <a href=\"https://github.com/emberjs/ember-render-modifiers\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">@ember/render-modifiers package</a>.
#       </p>"

#   did-insert:
#     title: Use element modifiers instead of didInsertElement
#     description: "Instead of writing a didInsertElement method in the JavaScript file, put the \\{\\{did-insert\\}\\} modifier in your template and say which function to call when that element is rendered. Label that function with the @action decorator.

#   will-destroy:
#     title: Using willDestroy
#     description: "willDestroy is called when the entire component's element will be destroyed, similar to willDestroyElement. You can use it as a method like below, or via a modifier similar to \\{\\{did-insert\\}\\} just above.

# routes:
#   title: Routes

#   model-access:
#     title: Accessing a route's model
#     description: The model used in a route template has always come from an outside context. For this reason, in Octane, refer to it as @model.
